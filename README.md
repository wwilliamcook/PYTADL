# PYTADL (Python YouTube Audio Downloader)

PYTADL is intended for use as an information retrieval tool for automatically analysing the audio in a YouTube video. It's core functionality is to fetch and return the audio in the form of a numpy array.

## Prerequisites

Requires `FFmpeg`. On Windows, `ffmpeg.exe` must be placed in the same folder as `python.exe` (adding it to `Path` will likely not work).

Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install python dependencies.

# Example Usage

Run `python example.py [youtube-url]` to get an idea for what PYTADL does.
