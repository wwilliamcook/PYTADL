# PYTADL (Python YouTube Audio Downloader)

## Prerequisites

Requires `FFmpeg`. On Windows, `ffmpeg.exe` must be placed in the same folder as `python.exe` (adding it to `Path` will likely not work).

Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install python dependencies.

# Example Usage

Run `python example.py [youtube-url]` to get an idea for what PYTADL does.
